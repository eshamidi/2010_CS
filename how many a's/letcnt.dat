C++ is a superset of C.  C is a programming language developed at AT&T BellLaboratories by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.  Ritchie originally intended C to beused to write the UNIX operating system and to write tools to be used withthat system.  Over the year, however, C has achieved widespread popularityfor writing various programs in industry, and it is now the language of choicein most graduate schools of computer science.  According to Richard P. Gabriel("The end of history the last programming language."  Journal of ObjectOriented Programming.  July-August 1993), C and C++ are among the fewprogramming languages that are not either dead or moribund.  There are severalreasons for this.  C is available on a wide range of computers and requires fewcomputer resources to design, implement, and run programs.  C represents a simplemachine mode, one that closely corresponds to the structure of actual computers.This property supports the development of very efficient programs.  C is alsosimilar to several different popular programming languages like Pascal, FORTRAN,and assembly language.  Finally, C requires almost no mathematicalsophistication to learn.  Critics claim that C is a dangerous language in two respects.First, C encourages programmers to write programs that lack structure andare difficult to read and maintain.  Second, C lacks many of the fail-safefeatures of modern programming languages, such as thorough compile-time typechecking.  Responding to the challenge, Bjarne Stroustrup, also of AT&T BellLaboratories, developed C++ in the 1980s.  C++ incorporates all of the desirableand undesirable features of C enumerated above.  However, some additionalfeatures, if used properly, make C++ a safer language and support the designand implementation of well-structured, easily maintained programs for both beginnersand professionals.  For example, C++ has strong support for data types andtype checking, and also has features that support the discipline ofobject-oriented programming (OOP).  Object oriented programming is a methodof developing and maintaining large software systems.  OOP is introduced andiscussed in later chapters in this text. Critics claim that C++ introducesits own costs:  The language is enormous, the machine model that it representsis more complex that of C, and programmers must have more mathematicalsophistication to make use of its improved features.  However, if Gabrielis right, students will do well to learn this language, because it will be usedin industry for many years to come.
